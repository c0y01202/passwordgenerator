# H1 Random Password Generator

This assignment required use of HTML and Javascript. The purpose of the assignment was to create a password generator that would include prompts to ask the user to select the following variables:

1. The number of characters in the password.

User then selects whether they need the following types of characters:

1. Lower case characters.
2. Upper case characters.
3. Numbers.
4. Special characters.

The user is prompted to select whether they would want any of the above with a prompt that asks them to "confirm" or "skip" the selection criteria.

To begin, I downloaded the starter code from Git Hub and then I modified the basic script to include the initial 4 variables as arrays. I then added conditional statements to the code. After writing code for the initial prompts I began to research how to build the algorithm that computes the random password. To build the algorithm I added concatonate features to the code which linked to each type of case or character to the arrays in the variables. I used Google Chrome to render the index.html file and Javascript code to continually test the code and its' functions.

I used office hours and teaching assistants to help me write the conditions and loops for this code. I also installed an extension called "Prettier" in VS to format the .js code.

I also used Google to access the following tutorials:
