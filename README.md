# H1 Random Password Generator

This assignment required use of HTML and Javascript. The purpose of the assignment was to create a password generator that would include prompts to ask the user to select the following variables:

1) The number of characters in the password.
2) Upper case characters.
3) Lower case characters.
4) Special characters.

The user is prompted to select whether they would want any of the above with a prompt that asks them to "confirm" or "skip" the selection criteria.

To begin, I downloaded the starter code from Git Hub and then I modified the basic script to include the initial 4 variables as arrays. I then added conditional statements to the code. After writing code for the initial prompts I began to research how to build the algorithm that computes the random password. To build the algorithm I added concatonate features to the code which linked to each type of case or character in the variables. I used Google Chrome to render the index.html file and Javascript code to continually test the code and its' functions. 

I also used Google to access the following tutorials:
